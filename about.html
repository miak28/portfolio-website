            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hello! I'm Tamia Jackson, a cybersecurity consultant. I specialize in creating unique encryption solutions to protect your privacy from software attacks and hackers.</p>
            <p>
                My journey in cybersecurity started when my parents computer software was hacked by scammers obtaining their personal information and someone using my dads SSN to file fraudulent accounts. Since then, I have worked on various projects, 
                including audits on encrypted emails and screening the data that comes from spam accounts. My passion is to create, learn, and share knowledge in cybersecurity, the metaverse security.
            </p>
